        Parameters
        ----------
        - calling_entity : char
            - Set to the character "S" or "R" to represent that the sender or 
              receiver, respectively, is the entity the timer is for. With 
              only unidirectional data transfer required in this project, the
              sender should be the only one calling this function.
        - increment : float

              the calling entity.
